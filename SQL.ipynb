You will first start querying data from the sample database. If you are already familiar with SQL, you will notice the differences between SQL standard and SQL dialect used in SQLite.\r\n","\r\n","Section 1. Simple query\r\n","* Select – query data from a single table using SELECT statement.\r\n","\r\n","Section 2. Sorting rows\r\n","* Order By – sort the result set in ascending or descending order.\r\n","\r\n","Section 3. Filtering data\r\n","\r\n","* Select Distinct – query unique rows from a table using the DISTINCT clause.\r\n","* Where  – filter rows of a result set using various conditions.\r\n","* Limit – constrain the number of rows returned by a query and how to get only the necessary data from a table.\r\n","* Between – test whether a value is in a range of values.\r\n","* In – check if a value matches any value in a list of values or subquery.\r\n","* Like – query data based on pattern matching using wildcard characters: percent sign (%) and underscore (_).\r\n","* Glob – determine whether a string matches a specific UNIX-pattern.\r\n","IS NULL – check if a value is null or not.\r\n","\r\n","Section 4. Joining tables\r\n","* SQLite join – learn the overview of joins including inner join, left join, and cross join.\r\n","* Inner Join – query data from multiple tables using the inner join clause.\r\n","* Left Join – combine data from multiple tables using the left join clause.\r\n","* Cross Join – show you how to use the cross join clause to produce a cartesian product of result sets of the tables involved in the join.\r\n","* Self Join – join a table to itself to create a result set that joins rows with other rows within the same table.\r\n","* Full Outer Join – show you how to emulate the full outer join in the SQLite using left join and union clauses.\r\n","\r\n","Section 5. Grouping data\r\n","* Group By – combine a set of rows into groups based on specified criteria. The GROUP BY clause helps you summarize data for reporting purposes.\r\n","* Having – specify the conditions to filter the groups summarized by the GROUP BY clause.\r\n","\r\n","Section 6. Set operators\r\n","* Union – combine result sets of multiple queries into a single result set. We also discuss the differences between UNION and UNION ALL clauses.\r\n","* Except – compare the result sets of two queries and returns distinct rows from the left query that are not output by the right query.\r\n","* Intersect – compare the result sets of two queries and returns distinct rows that are output by both queries.\r\n","\r\n","Section 7. Subquery\r\n","* Subquery – introduce you to the SQLite subquery and correlated subquery.\r\n","* Exists operator – test for the existence of rows returned by a subquery.\r\n","\r\n","Section 8. More querying techniques\r\n","* Case – add conditional logic to the query.\r\n","\r\n","Section 9. Changing data\r\n","\r\n","This section guides you on how to update data in the table using insert, update, delete, and replace statements.\r\n","\r\n","* Insert – insert rows into a table\r\n","* Update – update existing rows in a table.\r\n","* Delete – delete rows from a table.\r\n","* Replace – insert a new row or replace the existing row in a table.\r\n","\r\n","Section 10. Transactions\r\n","* Transaction – show you how to handle transactions in SQLite.\r\n","\r\n","Section 11.

Constraints\r\n","* Primary Key – show you how to define the primary key for a table.\r\n","* NOT NULL constraint – learn how to enforce values in a column are not NULL.\r\n","* UNIQUE constraint – ensure values in a column or a group of columns are unique.\r\n","* CHECK constraint – ensure the values in a column meet a specified condition defined by an expression.\r\n","* AUTOINCREMENT – explain how the AUTOINCREMENT column attribute works and why you should avoid using it.\r\n","\r\n","Section 13. Views\r\n","* Create View – introduce you to the view concept and show you how to create a new view in the database.\r\n","* Drop View – show you how to drop a view from its database schema.\r\n"," \r\n","Section 14.
